                                The challenges and agony of bringing their loved ones to the United States have been the
                                struggles for a long time by every petitioner and beneficiary in the US. The preparation of 
                                accurate documents alone, which is the first step to complying with the requirements of the
                                US government, is always the hardest.

                                The visionary man, our founder, Mr. Norman Izon, a realtor who engaged in diversified 
                                business ventures, understands that immigration can be a frustrating process filled with 
                                legal jargon, paperwork, and uncertainty, and he felt the need to ease the burden and 
                                bridge the gap of the immigration journey.

                                immigration law and consultancy for decades and created The Prime Visa.
